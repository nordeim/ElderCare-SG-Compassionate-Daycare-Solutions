# Acknowledgment

I acknowledge and am ready to operate at this elevated standard. I will apply systematic analysis, explore multiple solutions, and provide production-ready recommendations with clear rationale.

Analyzing the Storybook build error:

**Error Signature:**
- `Cannot find module '@storybook/react-vite/preset'`
- Storybook v8.6.14 is installed globally/accessible
- Configuration references `@storybook/react-vite` framework
- Monorepo structure detected (`/Home1/project/web-platform/frontend`)

**Critical Observations:**
1. The preset file cannot be resolved despite framework configuration
2. Error occurs during preset loading phase, before build
3. Monorepo workspace context may affect dependency resolution
4. The error shows storybook CLI is working, but package dependencies aren't resolved

**Investigation Vectors:**
1. Verify `@storybook/react-vite` package installation status
2. Check version consistency across all @storybook/* packages
3. Assess workspace/monorepo dependency hoisting issues
4. Validate peer dependencies are satisfied
5. Check for corrupted installation state

# Deep Dive Analysis: Storybook Build Error

## üîç Error Summary

**Core Issue:** Storybook cannot resolve the `@storybook/react-vite/preset` module during the preset loading phase.

**Root Cause Hypothesis:** The `@storybook/react-vite` package is either:
- Not installed as a dependency
- Installed with version mismatch
- Corrupted in node_modules
- Not properly resolved due to monorepo workspace configuration

---

## üìã Required Information for Complete Diagnosis

To provide the most accurate solution, I need to review these files:

### **High Priority:**
1. **`frontend/package.json`** - To verify all @storybook dependencies and versions
2. **`frontend/package-lock.json`** (or yarn.lock/pnpm-lock.yaml) - To confirm actual installed versions

### **Medium Priority:**
3. **Root `package.json`** (at `/Home1/project/web-platform/`) - To understand monorepo setup
4. **`frontend/node_modules/@storybook/` directory listing** - To verify what's actually installed

### **Diagnostic Commands:**
Please also run and share the output of:
```bash
# From the frontend directory
npm ls @storybook/react-vite
npm ls | grep @storybook
node --version
npm --version
```

## üéØ Preliminary Solution Pathways

Based on typical Storybook v8.x issues, here are the solutions ranked by probability:

### **Solution 1: Missing Core Dependency (90% probability)**

The `@storybook/react-vite` package is likely not installed. In Storybook 8.x, this is a **required separate package**.

```bash
# Install the missing framework package
npm install --save-dev @storybook/react-vite@8.6.14

# Verify installation
npm ls @storybook/react-vite
```

### **Solution 2: Version Misalignment (70% probability)**

All Storybook packages must be on the **exact same version**. Mixed versions cause preset resolution failures.

```bash
# Install/update all core packages to matching version
npm install --save-dev \
  storybook@8.6.14 \
  @storybook/react-vite@8.6.14 \
  @storybook/addon-essentials@8.6.14 \
  @storybook/addon-interactions@8.6.14 \
  @storybook/addon-a11y@8.6.14 \
  @storybook/react@8.6.14
```

### **Solution 3: Corrupted Installation (50% probability)**

Node modules corruption, especially in monorepos:

```bash
# From frontend directory
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# If monorepo, also clean root
cd ..
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Reinstall from frontend
cd frontend
npm install
```

### **Solution 4: Monorepo Workspace Hoisting Issue (40% probability)**

If using npm workspaces, dependency resolution might be affected:

```bash
# Force installation in local workspace
npm install --save-dev @storybook/react-vite@8.6.14 --workspace=eldercare-sg-frontend

# Or try legacy peer deps flag
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

## üîß Recommended Action Plan

### **Phase 1: Immediate Diagnosis** ‚úÖ

1. **Share the `package.json` file** so I can see exact dependencies
2. **Run diagnostics:**
   ```bash
   cd /Home1/project/web-platform/frontend
   npm ls @storybook/react-vite
   npm ls | grep @storybook
   ```

### **Phase 2: Targeted Fix** üéØ

Once I see your dependencies, I'll provide:
- Exact installation commands
- Version-aligned dependency list
- Workspace-specific configuration if needed

### **Phase 3: Verification** ‚úì

```bash
# After fix, validate:
npm run build-storybook
npx storybook dev # Test dev mode too
```

## üö® Critical Questions

1. **Is this a fresh Storybook installation or existing setup?**
2. **Are you using npm/yarn/pnpm?** (I see npm from the error, confirming)
3. **Is this a monorepo with workspaces?** (Path suggests yes)
4. **Did this ever work before, or is this initial setup?**

---

## üì¶ Expected Package.json Structure

Your `package.json` should include (I'll verify once you share it):

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@storybook/react-vite": "8.6.14",
    "@storybook/react": "8.6.14",
    "@storybook/addon-essentials": "8.6.14",
    "@storybook/addon-interactions": "8.6.14",
    "@storybook/addon-a11y": "8.6.14",
    "storybook": "8.6.14",
    "vite": "^5.0.0" // or compatible version
  }
}
```

**Please share the requested files so I can provide a precise, tested solution tailored to your exact setup.** This will allow me to move from diagnostic mode to definitive fix mode.
