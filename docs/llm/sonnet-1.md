# Acknowledgment of Readiness

I have thoroughly processed and internalized the comprehensive framework and project documentation for **ElderCare SG**. I am ready to operate at the elevated standard you've outlined.

## ✅ Confirmed Understanding

### **Project Context & Mission**
- **Mission**: Compassionate, accessibility-first digital bridge connecting Singaporean families with trusted elderly daycare services
- **Architecture**: Service-oriented Laravel 12 monolith + Next.js 14 server-first frontend, containerized with Docker, deployed on AWS ECS Fargate
- **Current Phase**: Pre-Phase 3 Remediation Stage (Phases 1 & 2 complete)

### **Core Principles Internalized**
1. **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 AA is non-negotiable; every component must pass `jest-axe`
2. **PDPA Compliance**: Legal requirement; consent ledgers, audit trails, data residency in Singapore
3. **Performance**: Lighthouse >90 performance & accessibility scores mandatory
4. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Multilingual (EN/ZH/MS/TA), respectful tone, Singapore-centric
5. **Test-Driven Quality**: >90% coverage, multi-layered testing (Jest, PHPUnit, Playwright, Percy, axe-core)

### **Operating Framework Commitment**
I pledge to apply on **every task**:
- 🧠 **Deep Analysis**: Explore multiple approaches before choosing optimal solution
- 📋 **Systematic Planning**: Break tasks into verifiable phases with clear success criteria
- ⚡ **Technical Excellence**: Production-ready, clean, well-documented code
- 🤝 **Strategic Partnership**: Proactive problem-solving, clear rationale for decisions
- 💬 **Transparent Communication**: `<think>` tags for deliberation, structured responses

### **Immediate Priorities Understood**
From `docs/llm/pre_phase3_remediation_execution_plan_2025-10-10.md`:
1. **Migration Hardening**: Add SQLite driver checks to `services`, `bookings`, `testimonials` migrations
2. **Analytics Bootstrap**: Finalize GA4, Hotjar, Sentry, New Relic scaffolding
3. **Infrastructure Docs**: Create `docs/deployment/cloudflare.md`, enhance `terraform/README.md`
4. **Design System QA**: Complete Storybook stories, capture Percy baseline
5. **Phase 3 Prep**: Architecture notes, service skeletons, OpenAPI drafts for auth & consent

### **Workflow Internalized**
For every task, I will execute:
1. **Analysis & Planning**: Task deconstruction → contextual review → codebase reconnaissance → detailed plan
2. **Implementation & Verification**: Environment sync → branch creation → TDD → code → local validation → docs
3. **Delivery & Handoff**: PR creation → checklist completion → CI/CD validation → review iteration → merge → monitoring

### **Quality Gates Acknowledged**
- All components must pass `jest-axe` (zero violations)
- All pages must achieve Lighthouse >90 (performance & accessibility)
- All PRs must pass CI pipeline (lint, test, Playwright, Percy)
- All changes must update relevant documentation in `docs/`
- All architectural decisions must be recorded in ADRs

## 🎯 Ready for Instructions

I am **fully briefed** and **operationally ready** to begin work on the ElderCare SG platform.

**What would you like me to work on first?**

Anticipated options:
1. **Start Pre-Phase 3 Remediation** (migration hardening, analytics bootstrap, etc.)
2. **Review specific codebase area** and provide analysis
3. **Create detailed execution plan** for a specific remediation task
4. **Other priority** you'd like to address

Please provide your directive, and I will respond with a structured plan (using `<think>` tags for deliberation) before proceeding with implementation.
