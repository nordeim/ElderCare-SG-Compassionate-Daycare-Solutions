## Executive Summary

The ElderCare SG platform is a comprehensive web solution designed to connect Singaporean families with quality elderly daycare services. This document outlines the technical architecture that will support a scalable, secure, and accessible platform while maintaining compliance with Singapore's regulatory requirements.

The architecture follows a modern microservices approach with clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend systems. It emphasizes performance, security, and accessibility while ensuring the platform can grow with the business needs.

## System Overview

ElderCare SG is a responsive web platform that serves as a bridge between elderly care service providers and families in Singapore. The platform provides:

- Information about daycare services and facilities
- Virtual tours of care centers
- Booking system for visits and services
- Testimonials and reviews from other families
- Contact and inquiry forms
- Multilingual support (English, Mandarin, Malay, Tamil)

The system is designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring optimal experience on smartphones and tablets, which are the primary devices used by the target audience.

## Architecture Principles

1. **User-Centric Design**: All architectural decisions prioritize the end-user experience, especially for elderly users and their families who may have varying levels of technical proficiency.

2. **Accessibility First**: The architecture is built with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as a foundational requirement, not an afterthought.

3. **Security by Design**: Security measures are integrated throughout the architecture, with particular attention to Singapore's PDPA requirements.

4. **Performance Optimized**: The architecture prioritizes fast loading times and smooth interactions, especially on mobile devices and slower connections.

5. **Scalable and Maintainable**: The system is designed to grow with the business while maintaining code quality and ease of maintenance.

6. **Data Privacy**: All data handling respects user privacy and complies with Singapore's data protection regulations.

7. **Cultural Sensitivity**: The architecture supports Singapore's multicultural context with proper internationalization and localization.

### Architecture Patterns

1. **Microservices Architecture**: The backend is organized into discrete services that communicate via APIs, allowing for independent scaling and maintenance.

2. **API-First Design**: All functionality is exposed through well-documented RESTful APIs, enabling future mobile app development.

3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Background processes and notifications are handled through an event-driven system using Redis queues.

4. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Separate models for read and write operations optimize performance for different use cases.
